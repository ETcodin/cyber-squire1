# --- TERRAFORM VARIABLES EXAMPLE (CD-AWS-AUTOMATION) ---
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your actual values
#
# Usage:
#   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
#   nano terraform.tfvars  # Edit with your values
#   terraform plan
#   terraform apply

# --- REQUIRED VARIABLES ---

# Your public IP address for SSH access (required)
# Get your IP: curl checkip.amazonaws.com
my_ip = "203.0.113.45/32"  # EXAMPLE IP - Replace with yours

# --- OPTIONAL VARIABLES (Uncomment to Override Defaults) ---

# AWS region (default: us-east-1)
# aws_region = "us-east-1"

# VPC and subnet configuration (defaults are sensible for most deployments)
# vpc_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"
# public_subnet_cidr  = "10.0.10.0/24"
# private_subnet_cidr = "10.0.20.0/24"
# availability_zone   = "us-east-1a"

# EC2 key pair name (default: cyber-squire-ops)
# key_name = "cyber-squire-ops"

# NAT instance type (default: t3.nano for cost optimization)
# Options: t3.nano ($3.80/mo), t3.micro ($7.50/mo), t4g.nano ($3.10/mo - ARM)
# nat_instance_type = "t3.nano"

# COREDIRECTIVE_ENGINE instance type (default: t3.xlarge for 16GB RAM)
# Options: t3.xlarge ($122/mo), t3.2xlarge ($244/mo), m5.xlarge ($140/mo)
# cdae_instance_type = "t3.xlarge"

# COREDIRECTIVE_ENGINE root volume size (default: 100GB)
# Minimum: 50GB (Docker + Ollama models), Maximum: 500GB
# cdae_volume_size = 100

# Project name for resource tagging (default: CD-AWS-AUTOMATION)
# project_name = "CD-AWS-AUTOMATION"

# Environment name (default: prod)
# Options: dev, staging, prod
# environment = "prod"

# --- NOTES ---
#
# 1. DO NOT commit terraform.tfvars to version control (add to .gitignore)
# 2. Use terraform.tfvars.example as a template for team members
# 3. For CI/CD, use environment variables: TF_VAR_my_ip=203.0.113.45/32
# 4. For multiple environments, use separate .tfvars files:
#    - terraform.tfvars.dev
#    - terraform.tfvars.staging
#    - terraform.tfvars.prod
#
#    Usage: terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.prod"
#
# 5. Get your current IP:
#    curl checkip.amazonaws.com
#    OR
#    curl ifconfig.me
#
# 6. For dynamic IP (changes frequently), consider:
#    - Using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (no SSH port needed)
#    - Setting up a VPN for static IP
#    - Using a bastion host with Elastic IP
#
# --- COST ESTIMATION ---
#
# With default values:
#   - CDAE Instance (t3.xlarge):  $122/month
#   - NAT Instance (t3.nano):     $3.80/month
#   - EBS Volume (100GB gp3):     $8/month
#   - Data Transfer (~50GB):      $5/month
#   Total:                        ~$139/month
#
# Savings vs AWS NAT Gateway:     $28/month ($336/year)
#
# --- EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS ---
#
# Development Environment (cost-optimized):
# my_ip = "203.0.113.45/32"
# cdae_instance_type = "t3.large"      # $61/mo (8GB RAM, sufficient for dev)
# cdae_volume_size = 50                # $4/mo (minimal storage)
# nat_instance_type = "t4g.nano"       # $3.10/mo (ARM, cheaper)
# environment = "dev"
#
# Production Environment (performance-optimized):
# my_ip = "203.0.113.45/32"
# cdae_instance_type = "m5.2xlarge"    # $280/mo (32GB RAM, better CPU)
# cdae_volume_size = 200               # $16/mo (more storage)
# nat_instance_type = "t3.micro"       # $7.50/mo (higher throughput)
# environment = "prod"
#
# Staging Environment (balanced):
# my_ip = "203.0.113.45/32"
# cdae_instance_type = "t3.xlarge"     # $122/mo (16GB RAM, standard)
# cdae_volume_size = 100               # $8/mo (standard storage)
# nat_instance_type = "t3.nano"        # $3.80/mo (cost-optimized)
# environment = "staging"
